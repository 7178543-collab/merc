**3 risks, 1 waste, 1 tuning** where v2 would act differently from v1.

## Risks (will stall or run out)

- **cloth**: sewing shop 1 ran short of cloth (no buy order); labour need rises ~14/turn when they restart -> v2: add a cloth buy
- **flax fibres**: flax fibres buffer 0.9 turns (holds 30, next step uses 32/turn) -> v2: check the step that makes it
- **flax plants**: flax plants buffer 1.0 turns (holds 80, next step uses 80/turn) -> v2: check the step that makes it

## Waste (money lost now)

- **labour**: 23 labour expired last turn (~35 coin): holding 16 against a ~0 buffer target -> v2: trim the buy until the stock is near 0

## Tuning

- **candles**: no sellers at home right now and stock is below the runway -> v2: import it or find another source

## Notes

- labour: projection runs 100 over real use lately; planning 493, not 593

## Prestige spending, cheapest coin per prestige first

763 turns left: prestige gained now converts 97.8% of itself into legacy. Church contracts (best known rate, 16-38) are not in the snapshot, so they are not ranked here.

- agreed **tenants** to level 11: done - level 12 (agreed 11)
- agreed **prestige_management** to level 2: done - level 2 (agreed 2)
- agreed **apprentices** to level 2: done - level 2 (agreed 2)

## Ships (last turn, real)

| Ship | Crew set / ran | Running cost | Route | Trips | Sold there | Bought there | Trade value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flax Wyrm | 0.0 / 0.00 | 0 | 134102075 | 0 | - | - | 0 |
| linen snake | 0.0 / 0.00 | 0 | 151802239 | 0 | - | - | 0 |

## Ship routes at today's world prices (estimate, per turn)

61 towns in range by sea. A snekkja on a route: 250 units a trip, 3000 moves a turn at full crew, running cost ~94 coin a turn at full crew (crew is sized to the cargo, floor 0.10). Markets: up to 30% of what each town trades a turn, 5% slippage each way.

| Town | Moves | Ship cost per size unit | Crew | Out per turn (sell there) | Back per turn (buy there) | Net/turn |

## Goal: business value (live: rates, buys, sells, ships, invest)
- Value now 9.4k (cash + stock at home prices); -70/turn over 6 turns, -121/turn over 24 turns.
- Limits: cash flow >= +96/turn, prestige >= +6.21/turn (values are after 200 tax a turn).
- Today's settings: value -47/turn, cash +16/turn, prestige -1.66/turn - breaks the prestige floor and cash floor.
- Plan: value -20/turn, cash +50/turn, prestige -1.66/turn - could not meet the prestige floor and cash floor.
- Cash check (real vs predicted cash a tick, last 3): +10 vs -18, +48 vs +17, -5 vs +16.
- Route sales counted at most (what the ships really sold, a turn): none.
- Changes, each priced on top of the one before (value/turn, limits aside):
  - weavery 1 0.00 -> 0.09: +8/turn
  - net maker 0.00 -> 0.28: +7/turn
  - spinnery 1 1.86 -> 2.24: -6/turn
  - flax farm 1 4.99 -> 6.35: -12/turn
  - retting pit 1 1.00 -> 1.27: +17/turn
- Model check over the last 59 turns: predicted +57/turn for the settings we ran, real -79/turn - OFF, trust the plan less.
- Worth of one more unit per turn: labour 157.56, thread 395.66, cloth 632.00, flax fibres 468.57, garments 1829.22, nets 2804.68, beer 275.77, timber 611.05, prestige 10000.00, cash 100.00
- Orders it would set: candles buy 1 (v2 2); cured meat buy 6 (v2 7); firewood buy 4 (v2 8); fish buy 0 (v2 None); furniture buy 2 (v2 None); grain buy 9 (v2 15); labour buy 16 (v2 0); light armour buy 1 (v2 None); meat buy 0 (v2 None); pasties buy 1 (v2 2)
- Management: ~11.39 of 17 used.
- Investments:
  - Tenants L13 for 500 prestige: +79/turn, doesn't pay yet (waits until 800 free (keeps 300 after))
- Trim: donate weavery 1: +11/turn (tax 18 saved).

## Chain sizing

Mode HOLD, garments sold 0.3/turn (+0.0 exported); plan makes 1.2 garments a turn.
Labour: own 500, everything else 374, chain may buy 0 -> chain allowance 126, chain plan 126 (-116 vs now).

| Step | Plots | Now | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| flax | 11 | 4.99 | 2.66 |
| ret | 3 | 1.00 | 0.53 |
| spin | 4 | 1.86 | 0.94 |
| weave | 3 | 0.00 | 0.05 |
| sew | 2 | 0.09 | 0.03 |

Buffers: flax fibres 30/36, thread 172/105, cloth 0/5
- chain plan needed 506 labour, budget left 126: cut to 126 (sewing capped at 0.03)

## Self-diagnosis

- R1: beer slot dry: 2.9 held, 19.2 a turn (drink slot (+0.4 prestige); mansion 1 hold banquet 1 (meat) (+4.2 prestige)); our buy none, home ask 3.34 (held back: failsafe level 3: reduce-only, would buy 25 @ 3.4 (ask 3.34, cap 14.4))
- R1: donations slot dry: 0.0 held, 40.0 a turn (luxury slot (+1 prestige)); our buy none, home ask 1.0 (held back: failsafe level 3: reduce-only, would buy 80 @ 1.02 (ask 1.0, cap 1.5))
- R1: fish slot dry: 0.0 held, 7.0 a turn (fine food slot (+0.3 prestige)); our buy none, home ask 1.79 (held back: failsafe level 3: reduce-only, would buy 14 @ 1.82 (ask 1.79, cap 2.6))
- R1: meat slot dry: 0.0 held, 7.0 a turn (fine food slot (+0.3 prestige)); our buy none, home ask none (no sellers at home)
