**1 risks, 0 waste, 0 tuning** where v2 would act differently from v1.

## Risks (will stall or run out)

- **flax fibres**: flax fibres buffer 1.0 turns (holds 27, next step uses 28/turn) -> v2: check the step that makes it

## Notes

- labour: projection runs 100 over real use lately; planning 525, not 625

## Prestige spending, cheapest coin per prestige first

673 turns left: prestige gained now converts 96.6% of itself into legacy. Church contracts (best known rate, 16-38) are not in the snapshot, so they are not ranked here.

- agreed **tenants** to level 11: done - level 12 (agreed 11)
- agreed **prestige_management** to level 2: done - level 2 (agreed 2)
- agreed **apprentices** to level 2: done - level 2 (agreed 2)

## Ships (last turn, real)

| Ship | Crew set / ran | Running cost | Route | Trips | Sold there | Bought there | Trade value |

## Ship routes at today's world prices (estimate, per turn)

61 towns in range by sea. A snekkja on a route: 250 units a trip, 3000 moves a turn at full crew, running cost ~94 coin a turn at full crew (crew is sized to the cargo, floor 0.10). Markets: up to 30% of what each town trades a turn, 5% slippage each way.

## Goal: business value (live: buys, sells, ships)
- Value now 15.8k (cash + stock at home prices); +204/turn over 6 turns, +104/turn over 24 turns.
- Limits: cash flow >= -87/turn, prestige >= +11.58/turn (values are after 200 tax a turn).
- Today's settings: value +110/turn, cash +112/turn, prestige -0.11/turn - breaks the prestige floor.
- Plan: value -109/turn, cash -82/turn, prestige +4.09/turn - could not meet the prestige floor.
- Cash check (real vs predicted cash a tick, last 3): +151 vs +109, +180 vs +108, +93 vs +104.
- Route sales counted at most (what the ships really sold, a turn): none.
- Changes, each priced on top of the one before (value/turn, limits aside):
  - net maker 0.00 -> 0.29: +4/turn
  - ropewalk 1 0.25 -> 0.31: +3/turn
  - sewing shop 1 0.30 -> 0.36: +2/turn
  - weavery 1 0.50 -> 0.58: +5/turn
  - spinnery 1 1.65 -> 1.98: -6/turn
  - flax farm 1 4.64 -> 5.60: -8/turn
  - retting pit 1 0.91 -> 1.12: +18/turn
  - brewery 1 0.14 -> 0.23: -16/turn
  - mansion 1 0.00 -> 1.00: -221/turn
- Model check over the last 58 turns: predicted +111/turn for the settings we ran, real +137/turn.
- Worth of one more unit per turn: labour 1.53, thread 3.84, cloth 6.14, flax fibres 4.55, garments 17.76, nets 27.73, beer 2.76, timber 2.81, prestige 10000.00, cash 0.00
- Orders it would set: candles buy 2 (v2 None); firewood buy 4 (v2 5); furniture buy 2 (v2 None); garments sell 11 (v2 10); grain buy 9 (v2 14); labour buy 29 (v2 25); light armour buy 1 (v2 None); meat buy 0 (v2 None); rope sell 2 (v2 1)
- Management: ~11.39 of 17 used.
- Investments:
  - Tenants L13 for 500 prestige: +76/turn, doesn't pay yet (waits until 800 free (keeps 300 after))

## Chain sizing

Mode HOLD, garments sold 10.2/turn (+0.0 exported); plan makes 33.2 garments a turn.
Labour: own 500, everything else 340, chain may buy 350 -> chain allowance 510, chain plan 510 (+221 vs now).

| Step | Plots | Now | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| flax | 11 | 4.64 | 6.50 |
| ret | 3 | 0.91 | 1.30 |
| spin | 4 | 1.65 | 2.30 |
| weave | 3 | 0.50 | 1.30 |
| sew | 2 | 0.30 | 0.81 |

Buffers: flax fibres 27/78, thread 189/230, cloth 59/130
- chain plan needed 511 labour, budget left 510: cut to 510 (sewing capped at 0.81)

## Self-diagnosis

- R1: meat slot dry: 0.0 held, 7.0 a turn (fine food slot (+0.3 prestige)); our buy none, home ask none (no sellers at home)
